as you are a professional software engineer backend and frontend and mobile apps and expert in Node.js, Supabase, flutter, UI/UX, Naming convention , and all needed tech stack for my CleanMateX project , generate a set of development rules and instructions for my AI coding assistance (Claude Code). each tech rules in separate file.

#ONLY rules and instructions not large files.

example of naming :

- Naming Rules:-

Model files end with (_model)

Screen ends with (_screen)

State Files end with _stat.dart

Widget ends with ( _widget)

Card separate files ends with ( _card )

View only widget ends with ( _vw)

High level constants or reusable files start with (app_ ) such as app_theme.dart

High level reusable widgets files start with (app_ ) and ends with _widget such as app_custom_txt_fld_widget.dart.

Model files: End with _model (e.g., user_model.dart).

Screen files: End with _screen (e.g., login_screen.dart).

Widget files: End with _widget (e.g., app_button_widget.dart).

Card widgets: End with _card (e.g., appointment_card.dart).

View-only widgets: End with _vw (e.g., profile_vw.dart).

High-level constants: Start with app_ (e.g., app_theme.dart).

Utils file end with ( _util.dart )

I'm ready to start building CleanMateX. Please begin implementation following the development plans in docs/plan/.

Start with PRD-001 (Authentication & Authorization).

Key context:
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL (local dev setup ready)
- Frontend: Next.js in web-admin/
- All plans are in docs/plan/
- Follow CLAUDE.md for architecture patterns

Please implement PRD-001 step by step, starting with:
1. Review the PRD at docs/plan/001_auth_dev_prd.md
2. Create the necessary database migrations
3. Implement RLS policies
4. Build the backend API endpoints
5. Create the frontend authentication UI
6. Add tests

Show me your implementation plan before starting, and let me approve it.
