# ⛔ HARD STOP — READ BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

**Before writing ANY code, SQL, migration, component, route, or translation — load the relevant skill first. No exceptions. The rule is at line 48. This is not optional.**

| Writing... | Load first |
|---|---|
| SQL / migration / function | `/database` |
| Frontend / component / JSX | `/frontend` |
| i18n / translation | `/i18n` |
| API route / service / backend | `/backend` |
| Any `org_*` table query | `/multitenancy` |
| New feature | `/implementation` |

**If the skill is not loaded — do not write. Load it, then write.**

# CLAUDE.md — CleanMateX Tenant App · F:\jhapp\cleanmatex\CLAUDE.md

**Project:** CleanMateX — Multi-Tenant Laundry SaaS Platform (GCC-first, EN/AR bilingual)
**Last Update:** 22-03-2026
**Last Update Description:** Added /storybook skill + storybook-generator agent to mandatory loading table

---

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Never do Supabase db reset** — tell the user, they'll run db migrations
2. **Never modify existing migration files** — always create a NEW migration for fixes or changes
3. **NEVER apply/run database migrations** — create migration SQL files only, then STOP and ask to review. Do NOT use Supabase MCP, CLI, or any tool to execute migrations.
4. **Every query MUST filter by `tenant_org_id`** — NO EXCEPTIONS (unless table has no tenant_org_id)
5. **After frontend changes: run `npm run build`** and fix until success
6. **Bilingual support (EN/AR + RTL) is mandatory**
7. **Use agents for exploration** — see efficiency guide below
8. **Use `/clear` frequently** — when switching topics or context >70%
9. **Check skills for detailed rules** — use `/skill-name` for specifics
10. **Navigation changes are DUAL-WRITE** — any add/modify to navigation MUST update BOTH `web-admin/config/navigation.ts` (frontend sidebar) AND generate a DB migration for `sys_components_cd` using the `/navigation` skill. Neither alone is complete.
11. **New permissions MUST have a migration** — every new permission code added to the system requires a corresponding DB migration file that seeds it into the permissions table. Never define a permission only in TypeScript without the DB migration.
12. **Constants MUST mirror DB names** — when a constant value already exists as a column value, status code, or enum in the database, the TypeScript constant MUST use the exact same string (case, spelling, separator). No mapping layers, no reformatting. Drift between DB values and TS constants causes silent bugs.
13. **Permission codes MUST follow `resource:action` format** — every permission code must match `^[a-z0-9_]+:([a-z0-9_]+|\*)$|^\*:\*$`. Lowercase letters, digits, and underscores only. Wildcard actions (`orders:*`) and global wildcard (`*:*`) are the only allowed `*` forms. Examples: `orders:read` ✅  `customers:*` ✅  `Orders:Read` ❌  `orders.read` ❌

## Identity & Cross-Project Awareness

**YOU ARE IN:** `cleanmatex` (Tenant-Facing Application) · `F:\jhapp\cleanmatex`
**SIBLING PROJECT:** `cleanmatexsaas` (Platform HQ Console) · `F:\jhapp\cleanmatexsaas`

This project owns **all database migrations**. cleanmatexsaas never creates migrations.

**Quick decision:**
- Tenant Operations (Orders, Customers, Inventory, Lite ERP) → **here**
- Platform Admin (Tenant Management, Billing, Analytics) → **cleanmatexsaas**
- Dual-Purpose (Settings, Feature Flags, Audit Logs) → **both** (see contracts)

**For cross-project work, context switches, migration protocol, ADR approval, and integration contracts:**
→ **`docs/dev/rules/integration-contracts.md`** is the single source of truth.

**API-Based Consumption (MANDATORY):**
- Settings (`sys_stng_*`) → managed by cleanmatexsaas, consumed here via HQ API
- Feature Flags (`sys_feature_flags_*`) → managed by cleanmatexsaas, consumed here via HQ API
- ❌ NEVER query `sys_stng_*` or `sys_feature_flags_*` directly from this project

## Mandatory Skill Loading Before Writing Code

Before writing ANY code, ALWAYS load the relevant skill(s) first. No exceptions.

| Task type | Load skill first |
|---|---|
| Any SQL, migration, table, index, function | `/database` |
| Any frontend component, page, hook, JSX | `/frontend` |
| Any i18n key, translation, bilingual text | `/i18n` |
| Any API route, service, backend logic | `/backend` |
| Any query touching `org_*` tables | `/multitenancy` |
| Any new feature implementation | `/implementation` |
| Any inline comment, JSDoc, SQL comment, config annotation | `/code-documentation` |
| Any `.stories.tsx` file, new Cmx component | `/storybook` |
| Any navigation add/modify (sidebar, routes, menu items) | `/navigation` |

**How to enforce:**
- Plan mode: load skills during Phase 1 exploration, before Phase 2 design
- Execution mode: load skills before writing the first line of code for that domain
- If a skill was not loaded and you wrote code — stop, load the skill, verify compliance, fix if needed

---

## Agent-First Workflow

**ALWAYS use agents for:**
- Exploratory questions: "How does X work?" → Explore agent
- Finding code: "Where is Y?" → Explore agent
- Research: "What's the structure of Z?" → Explore agent
- Multi-file tasks: Implementation, debugging, testing → specialized agents

**Direct actions only for:**
- Specific file edits with exact path
- Single file reads
- Precise line-level changes

**See:** `docs/dev/claude-code-efficiency-guide.md`

---

## Quick Commands

```bash
.\scripts\dev\start-services.ps1  # Start all services
cd web-admin; npm run dev          # Start web admin
npm run build                      # Build (run after changes)
```

---

## Database Quick Rules

- Tables: `sys_*` (global), `org_*` (tenant with RLS)
- Max 30 chars for all DB objects
- **NEVER modify existing migration files** — always create a NEW migration
- **Migrations: always use last seq** — list `supabase/migrations/`, take next version (e.g. after `0082` use `0083`), name `{version}_{descriptive_snake_case}.sql`
- **DROP ... CASCADE is BANNED by default** — always use `DROP ... RESTRICT`. CASCADE is only allowed when: (1) no safer alternative exists, (2) a full dependency manifest has been produced, (3) recreate statements + rollback strategy are in the same migration. STOP and get user confirmation before writing any CASCADE migration. See `docs/dev/drop-cascade-migration-workflow.md`
- Audit fields: `created_at/_by/_info`, `updated_at/_by/_info`
- Bilingual: `name/name2`, `description/description2`
- Soft delete: `is_active=false`, `rec_status=0`
- Money fields: `DECIMAL(19, 4)`
- No default value for `currency_code`, `country`, `city`, `timezone`, or any locale-related field
- **Permissions require a migration** — every new permission code must be seeded into the DB permissions table via a migration file. A permission that exists only in TypeScript/code but not in the DB is incomplete. Include ALL new permissions for a feature in a single dedicated migration.
- **Navigation requires a migration** — every new or modified navigation entry must have a corresponding `sys_components_cd` migration. Use the `/navigation` skill to generate it. See CRITICAL RULE #10.

**See:** `/database` skill for complete rules

## Hard Truth (Critical Mistakes to Avoid)

❌ Mistake 1: Putting logic in controllers → kills scalability
❌ Mistake 2: Mixing orders + workflow → loses flexibility forever
❌ Mistake 3: No use-cases layer → business logic becomes unmaintainable
❌ Mistake 4: Ignoring events → tight coupling everywhere

---

## Code Quick Rules

- TypeScript strict, no `any`
- No hardcoded secrets
- In `web-admin`, use the centralized tenant-context utilities where the implementation requires them
- In `cmx-api`, pass tenant context explicitly through guards/request context and service boundaries

**See:** `/implementation` skill for coding standards
**See:** `/code-documentation` skill for JSDoc patterns, SQL migration comments, Tailwind annotations, and config file documentation rules

**Feature docs:** When implementing any feature, document: permissions, navigation tree/screen, tenant settings, feature flags, plan limits, i18n keys, API routes, migrations, RBAC changes, env vars. See `.claude/skills/implementation/prd-rules.md`.

---

## Constants & Types (single source of truth)

- **Constants live in `lib/constants/`** — one file per domain (`payment.ts`, `order-types.ts`). Define `as const` objects and derive types: `type X = (typeof CONST)[keyof typeof CONST]`
- **Types/interfaces live in `lib/types/`** — import const-derived types from constants; re-export types and key consts for single-import usage
- **Do not duplicate** — same concept in one place only; other files re-export or import. Zod validation should align with the same constants
- **Order status:** workflow order status → `lib/types/workflow.ts`; payment-related → `lib/constants/payment.ts` + `lib/types/payment.ts`
- **DB-mirror rule (CRITICAL):** Before defining any constant whose value is stored in the database (status codes, type codes, permission codes, enum values, lookup codes), first check the DB for the existing value. The TypeScript constant value MUST be the exact same string — same case, same separators, same spelling. Example: if the DB column stores `'PENDING_PAYMENT'`, the constant must be `PENDING_PAYMENT: 'PENDING_PAYMENT'`, not `'pending-payment'` or `'PendingPayment'`. This applies to `lib/constants/`, Zod enums, and any lookup that round-trips to/from the DB.

**See:** `docs/dev/unification_types_order_payment_audit.md`

---

## UI Quick Rules

- **web-admin UI:** Use **Cmx components only**. Import from `@ui/primitives`, `@ui/feedback`, `@ui/overlays`, `@ui/forms`, `@ui/data-display`, `@ui/navigation`. Do **not** use `@ui/compat` (removed). Use exact import lines from **`web-admin/.clauderc`** → `ui_components`
- **web-admin TS/UI (tsc):** Follow `.cursor/rules/web-admin-typecheck-patterns.mdc` (discriminated unions, `CmxButton`/`Badge`/`CmxSummaryMessage`/`CmxDialog`, RHF+Zod `Resolver`, Recharts `Legend` wrapper, `useState` widening, ARIA booleans)
- Search existing message keys before adding new ones; reuse `common.*` keys for shared UI
- Use `cmxMessages` when applicable
- Run `npm run check:i18n` after translation changes
- Reports naming: `{feature-name}-{report-name}-rprt.tsx` (e.g. `orders-payments-print-rprt.tsx`)

**See:** `/i18n` skill · `/frontend` skill · `.claude/docs/web-admin-ui-imports.md` · `docs/dev/ui-migration-guide.md`

## How to Make Cursor/Claude Follow the Rules

1. **Always-applied rules (Cursor):** `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` with `alwaysApply: true` loaded automatically. Keep critical, short rules there.
   Current rule files: `constants-db-mirror.mdc`, `navigation-dual-write.mdc`, `permissions-migration.mdc`
   **→ Claude equivalent:** Same rules in CLAUDE.md CRITICAL RULES + `.claude/skills/` (implementation, navigation, database)

2. **CLAUDE.md (Claude):** Always in context — primary source for CRITICAL RULES.

3. **Skills (Claude):** Use `/frontend`, `/i18n`, `/database`, etc. CLAUDE.md points to the right skill per topic.

4. **Enforcement at build time:** ESLint (`no-restricted-imports`) forbids `@ui/compat` and `@/components/ui`. `npm run build` catches all violations.

5. **web-admin/.clauderc:** Authoritative import snippets for Cmx components. Update when adding/changing shared UI.

6. **Explicit prompts:** When you want a rule followed, say it ("Use Cmx components only and import from .clauderc").

---

## Supabase MCPs

- **NEVER apply db migrations via MCP or any way** — create the `.sql` file, then STOP and ask to review
- Local: `supabase_local MCP`
- Remote: `supabase_remote MCP`
- MCP allowed for **read-only discovery queries only** (e.g. finding affected objects before DROP CASCADE)
- **DROP ... CASCADE:** Use MCP read queries to discover affected objects, include recreate statements in the migration file. See `docs/dev/drop-cascade-migration-workflow.md`

# CleanMateX Repository Additional Rules - from chatgpt

## Mission

- Keep changes scoped, reversible, and easy to review.
- Do not create unnecessary churn.

## Architecture guardrails
- Respect current module boundaries and app structure.
- Reuse shared UI, hooks, services, table patterns, utilities, and domain logic whenever possible.
- Avoid moving files, renaming modules, or broad folder reorganization unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve current app/router/data-flow patterns unless the task explicitly requires change.

## Implementation rules
- Fix root causes, not surface symptoms.
- Keep backward compatibility unless explicitly told otherwise.
- Avoid speculative refactors.
- Avoid broad formatting of unrelated files.
