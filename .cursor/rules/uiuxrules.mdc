# 🎨 UI/UX Design Rules

## Layout & Structure
- Use a **dashboard-first layout** with clear separation between admin and customer views.
- Prioritize **modular components**: cards, tables, filters, and action panels.
- Maintain consistent spacing, padding, and grid alignment across all screens.

## Navigation
- Use **sidebar navigation** for desktop and **bottom tab bar** for mobile.
- Include breadcrumb trails for nested views.
- Highlight active routes and provide back navigation on all subpages.

## Visual Hierarchy
- Use **typography scale** to differentiate headings, labels, and body text.
- Apply **color contrast** to emphasize primary actions and alerts.
- Group related actions visually (e.g., batch actions, filters, export buttons).

## Accessibility
- Ensure **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** for contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.
- Use semantic HTML tags and `aria-*` attributes.
- Avoid color-only indicators; pair with icons or labels.

## Responsiveness
- Design for **mobile-first**, then scale up to tablet and desktop.
- Use `flexbox` and `grid` for adaptive layouts.
- Test across breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px.

## Feedback & States
- Show **loading indicators** for async actions.
- Use toast/snackbar for success and error messages.
- Include empty states with helpful prompts and icons.

## Forms & Inputs
- Use floating labels or placeholders, never both.
- Validate inputs inline with clear error messages.
- Group related fields and use progressive disclosure for complex forms.

## Branding & Theme
- Apply CleanMateX brand colors, fonts, and iconography consistently.
- Support **dark mode** and **RTL layout** via global theme toggles.
- Store theme config in `ui/theme.ts` or `flutter_theme.dart`.

## Microinteractions
- Animate transitions subtly (e.g., fade, slide).
- Use hover and focus states for buttons and inputs.
- Provide visual feedback on drag-and-drop, toggles, and switches.

## Documentation & Handoff
- Document all components in Storybook (React) or Widgetbook (Flutter).
- Include usage examples, props, and accessibility notes.
- Sync design tokens with Figma via plugin or JSON export.

## UI Imports & AI Hints (web-admin)
- Use **Cmx design system** only: import from `@ui/primitives`, `@ui/feedback`, `@ui/overlays`, `@ui/forms`, `@ui/data-display`, `@ui/navigation`. Do not use `@ui/compat` (removed).
- **web-admin/.clauderc** holds recommended import snippets for AI-generated code (`ui_components`). Keep it in sync with `src/ui` when adding or changing shared components. See `.cursor/rules/frontendstandards.mdc` (section "web-admin/.clauderc (AI Hints)") and `docs/dev/ui-migration-guide.md`.
