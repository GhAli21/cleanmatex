## 📝 Implementation Pattern

For each component:
1. Add `useTranslations` and `useRTL` hooks
2. Replace hardcoded strings with translation keys
3. Add RTL-aware CSS classes
4. Update translation files (en.json, ar.json) with new keys
5. Test in both languages

---

## 🎯 Goals

- **100% Translation Coverage** - All user-facing text translated
- **100% RTL Support** - All components work perfectly in Arabic
- **Consistent UX** - Same experience in both languages
- **Maintainable Code** - Centralized translations, reusable patterns

---

**Status**: Continuing systematically through ALL remaining ~62 components to achieve 100% translation and RTL coverage.
